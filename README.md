# OBSERVATIONS
## Scatter Plot (Plot of 'Literacy Rate versus Drop-out Rate' in various states of India)
1. Literacy rate of Kerala is highest and drop out rate is fifth lowest
2. Literacy rate of Bihar is lowest and it has a drop out rate second to Nagaland
3. Observing the trends, it may be concluded that high drop-out is directly proportional to low literacy rate
4. Jharkhand seems to be an outlier as it has both low drop-out rate and literacy rate which indicates that the problem of low literacy there is associated with other factors than drop-out 
5. Mizoram has the 2nd highest literacy rate but a high drop-out rate as well which makes it an outlier too and indicates that people even after dropping out are still educated

## Box Plot (Plots of 'Population of Students per Institute and School' in all states of India)
1. The medians are written in bold at the top of each box plot
2. It can be observed that population of students per school is much more than any of the 3 institutes
3. There are more number of students per 'Secondary/Higher Secondary' school than per Elementary school
4. Among the 3 institutes - 'University', 'College' and 'Technical', each 'College' experiences the lowest population of students than 'University' and 'Technical'.
5. Per 'University', number of students is the most.
6. The outlier state (Chandigarh) in 'Elementary' schools has the most number of students per educational institute across all categories.

## Bar Plot (Plot of 'Teacher versus Pupil Ratio' in various states of India)
1. We can observe from the bar plot that Bihar has the highest teacher to pupil ratio
2. This implies that for each teacher there are more number of students in Bihar than any other state in India
3. Also, Mizoram has the lowest ratio implying it has the least number of students per teacher
